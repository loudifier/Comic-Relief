Comic Relief is a typeface designed to be metrically equivalent to the popular Comic Sans MS. Comic Relief can be used in place of Comic Sans MS without having to move, resize, or reset any part of the copy.

Comic Relief is freely available via loudifier.com/comic-relief as a .ttf, FontForge .sfd project, and as a web-ready @font-face kit. It is copylefted using the SIL Open Font License, so feel free to use it, modify it, or embed it as you see fit.
